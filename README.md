# üíª JavaScript Learning & Problem Solving
Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to mastering JavaScript. This collection is a log of my solutions to various programming challenges, organized by topic to track my progress and serve as a quick reference.

## üó∫Ô∏è My JavaScript Learning Journey
This repository is structured around my study path, which focuses on both fundamental concepts and advanced techniques. The topics covered reflect my commitment to building a strong and comprehensive understanding of the language.

### Fundamentals & Core Concepts
- Basic: The absolute essentials of JavaScript syntax.

- Fundamental(ES6) Part-I & Part-II: Deep diving into modern JavaScript features introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond.

- Conditional Statements and Loops: Building logic and control flow.

- Functions: Writing reusable blocks of code.

- Error Handling: Managing and responding to unexpected issues (try...catch).

- Math: Using the built-in Math object for numerical operations.

- Datetime: Working with dates and times.

- Object: Understanding and manipulating objects.

- String/Text: Working with text data.

- Bit Manipulation: Performing operations at the bit level.

### Data Structures & Algorithms
- Recursion: Solving problems by calling the function itself.

- Array: Working with ordered lists of data.

- Stack: Implementing LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structures.

- Linked List: Creating and managing dynamic data structures.

- Sorting Algorithm: Techniques for ordering data (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort).

- Searching Algorithm: Methods for finding specific elements (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search).

### Advanced & Asynchronous JavaScript
- DOM (Document Object Model): Interacting with web page elements.

- Drawing: Creating visuals with JavaScript.

- Event Handling: Responding to user and browser events.

- Asynchronous: Handling non-blocking operations.

- Promises, Async/Await: Modern patterns for managing asynchronous code.

- Module Import/Export: Organizing code into modular files.

### Code Validation
- Validation with Regular Expression: Using patterns to validate data.

- Validation without Regular Expression: Writing custom validation logic.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Object-Oriented Programming: Exploring classes, inheritance, and encapsulation in JavaScript.
